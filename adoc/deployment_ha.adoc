[#pr-deployment-ha]
== Deployment with High Availability
:revdate: 2025-03-05
:page-revdate: {revdate}

You can use {helm} to deploy highly available (HA) {productnameshort} on a {kube} cluster.
The HA setup ensures that users do not experience interruptions of service if one of the nodes on which {productnameshort} is running becomes unavailable.

[#pr-deployment-ha-architecture]
=== Architecture of the HA setup 

Most of the {productnameshort} components are now stateless.
Therefore, we can scale them by increasing pod replicas, ensuring they run on multiple worker nodes.
{kube} services ensure connectivity between pods.

For storage, users should provide an HA {postgresql} and {valkey} or {redis} cluster for application data, along with PVCs or object storage for storing images and charts.

[#pr-deployment-ha-prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites
* A {kube} cluster version 1.20 or higher
* {helm} version 3.2.0 or higher
* HA {ingress} controller ({productnameshort} does not manage the external endpoint)
* HA {postgresql} 9.6+ ({productnameshort} does not handle the deployment of HA database)
* HA {valkey} or {redis} ({productnameshort} does not handle the deployment of HA {valkey} or {redis})
* Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) that can be shared across nodes or external object storage
* An active subscription for {productname}

[#pr-deployment-ha-procedure]
=== Deploying {productnameshort} with HA

. Download the {productnameshort} {helm} chart.
[source]
  $ helm pull oci://registry.suse.com/private-registry/private-registry-helm --untar
. Update the deployment parameters to match your requirements.
Refer to <<pr-ha-helm-chart-example>> for an example {helm} chart for {productnameshort} HA setup.
Refer to <<pr-helm-chart-override>> for a complete list of values to specify or override.
. Install the {productnameshort} {helm} chart.
Replace `<RELEASE_NAME>` with your custom release name for the {helm} chart deployment.
[source]
  $ helm install <RELEASE_NAME> private-registry-helm/
