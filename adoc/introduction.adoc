[#pr-what-is-spr]
=== What is {productname}?
{productname} ({productnameshort}) is an on-premises container registry.
{productnameshort} is designed for {suse} customers who need a container registry that works well with other {suse} services and products.

[#pr-what-are-pr-benefits]
=== What are {productname} benefits?
{productnameshort} is based on the {harbor} project and includes all its core features as well as added benefits. For example:

* *On-premises container registry.* {productnameshort} is a locally hosted container registry with access to online {suse} registry services.
* *Security.* {productnameshort} offers security considerations for containerized environments.
It includes authentication, authorization and vulnerability scanning.
* *Deployment flexibility.* You can install {productnameshort} on a {kube} environment such as {rke2}.
You can also deploy {productnameshort} with High Availability setup.
* *User management.* {productnameshort} provides authentication and authorization mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC).
* *User interface.* Besides a command-line interface, you can administer {productnameshort} via Web user interface.

[#pr-how-does-pr-work]
=== How does {productname} work?
{productnameshort} is delivered as _Open Container Initiative_ (OCI) containers and is expected to be deployed on a {kube} cluster.
{productnameshort} consists of the following containers:

* **harbor-core:** the main component of the {harbor} registry, responsible for handling core functionalities such as managing projects, repositories and user interactions.
* **harbor-db:** the database container that stores all metadata related to images, users and configurations for the {harbor} registry.
* **harbor-jobservice:** a service that manages background jobs, such as image replication and scheduled tasks, ensuring efficient processing of operations within the registry.
* **harbor-nginx:** the reverse proxy and load balancer that routes incoming requests to the appropriate {harbor} services, providing a single entry point for users.
* **harbor-portal:** the Web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the {harbor} registry, manage images, and configure settings through a graphical interface.
* **harbor-registry:** the container that serves as the actual image storage back-end, handling the storage and retrieval of container images.
* **harbor-registryctl:** a command-line tool for managing the {harbor} registry, allowing users to perform administrative tasks and configurations directly from the terminal.
* **harbor-trivy-adapter:** a container that integrates the {trivy} vulnerability scanner with {harbor}, enabling automated security scanning of container images for vulnerabilities.
* **harbor-exporter:** the container that exports {harbor} metrics in a format that can be collected by {prometheus} for monitoring and observability.
* **harbor-valkey:** an in-memory key-value store.

After deployment, you can log in via Web user interface.
After successful authentication and authorization, you can configure multiple aspects of the product, for example:

* Configure *global settings*, such as setting the registry to read-only mode or restricting who can create projects.
* Select an *authentication* method.
* Add users when in database authentication mode and assign the system *administrator role* to other users.
* Apply resource *quotas* to projects.
* Set up the *replication* of images between {productnameshort} instances.
