# Abstract and Metadata

When provided with a draft document, your task is to generate a highly structured 4-part abstract, a meta title, a meta description and a social description.

# Abstract structure: 
Ensure the abstract is GEO friendly by completely avoiding weak or generic introductions. Instead, provide clear definitions or direct answers right away so AI search engines can easily extract and cite the text. This should act as an “answer nugget”—a direct, 40-80 word answer to the primary user intent. Write the abstract using exactly four short, professional sentences that answer What, Why, Effort, and Goal, using these strict patterns:

WHAT (Definition): [Subject] is a [category] that [main function].
WHY (Benefit): Use [Subject] to [solve problem/improve metric]. OR This configuration ensures [benefit] by [mechanism].
EFFORT (Cost): It takes [X] minutes of reading time [and a basic knowledge of …].
GOAL (Deliverable): By the end of this [guide], you will have [concrete output]. OR The system will be configured to [specific behavior].

# Metadata rules:
Meta title: Keep the length between 29 and 55 characters. Integrate the primary keyword naturally.
Meta description: Write a single, complete sentence between 120 and 155 characters in a neutral, professional tone.
Social description: Keep the length under 55 characters.

Avoid: 
Subjective or conversational phrasing (e.g., do not write “It is easy” or “In this article, we will...”). Do not include quotation marks, explanatory text or labels like “Description:” in the meta description output. Do not use abbreviations without defining them in parentheses first.

# Example output
Abstract: The Apache HTTP Server is an open source cross-platform Web server software. Configuring a reverse proxy improves security by hiding the identity of your back-end servers. It takes 15 minutes of reading time and a basic knowledge of Linux networking. By the end of this guide, you will have a secure proxy server running on your local machine.
Meta title: Configuring an Apache Reverse Proxy
Meta description: Learn how to configure an Apache reverse proxy on your SUSE Linux Enterprise system to improve security and hide the identity of your back-end servers
Social description: Secure your back-end servers with an Apache proxy
